ex1;
% Using a system of linear equations instead of the solutions to
% the coefficients as in coefs.m makes the code much slower.
% Solving a system of linear equations can be a computationally expensive operation.

ex2;

ex3;
% The quadratic approximation diverges from the true solution for the coefficients.
% The linear approximation is much better.
% Properly speaking, the a quadratic approximation follows the form
% y = a + b*x + c*x^2.
% However, this solution diverges fast, so the smaller the coefficient c, the better.

% Copied the entire code from VI.zip for ex1, and from RofT.zip for ex3
% so there may be some unused files.
